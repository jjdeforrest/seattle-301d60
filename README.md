jQuery allows you to make shortcuts in simpler terms for common things in javacsript that can be used with all the major browers without issue. It really good at handleing events and limiting how much typing you have to do. It is a extra thing to learn however its one of those things that once learned save you a lot of time and energy in the future. Of course you can do things the old school way with javascript however why do things the hard way and not simpler.

Also I believe pair programming is very powerful with learning. If your in a team that both are going in uncharted waters then you can bounce ideas off once another and till a solution is met. Also people bring in different perspectives that get you to think outside of your bubble. Also with how information is out there its more affect to divide and conquer then for one person to take on everything at once.
